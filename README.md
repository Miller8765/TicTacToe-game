Tic-Tac-Toe Game üéÆ

This is a simple, command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game created in Python. It's built with an object-oriented approach, separating the game logic from the board's state and functions.

  Features ‚ú®

  * **Two-player mode:** Players can take turns entering their moves.
  * **Input validation:** The game checks for valid moves, preventing players from choosing an occupied space or an out-of-range position.
  * **Win condition checking:** The game automatically detects when a player has won.
  * **Draw condition checking:** It can also identify when the game has ended in a draw.
  * **Clear and simple interface:** The board is displayed clearly in the terminal, using a coordinate system (row and column).

## Project Structure üìÅ

The game is organized into two main files for better modularity:

  * **`board.py`**: Contains the **`Board` class**, which manages the game's state. It handles displaying the board, placing symbols, and checking for win or draw conditions.
  * **`game.py`**: This is the main entry point for the game. It manages the game loop, switches between players, handles user input, and calls methods from the `Board` class to update and display the game.
